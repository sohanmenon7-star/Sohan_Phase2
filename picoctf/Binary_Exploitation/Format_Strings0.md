## Solution:

- The first thing I did for this question, was look at the hint(It was really helpful for the previous question). The hint told me to research on format specifiers
- The first message told me that the customer needs a giant bite, upon selecting a random option it displayed the error, That the option was not big enough
- This made me realize that the second option Grilled cheese had `%114d` present in it, which always has 114 spaces of integers
- I then proceeded to the next customer which wanted something to break the shop
- This gave me the clue that it wanted an error of sorts, The option CLa%sic_Che%s%steak had three string format specifiers(`%s`) without proper arguments, which would cause a segmentation fault(I think) which sent the signal to the function, printing the flag

Welcome to our newly-opened burger place Pico 'n Patty! Can you help the picky customers find their favorite burger?
Here comes the first customer Patrick who wants a giant bite.
Please choose from the following burgers: Breakf@st_Burger, Gr%114d_Cheese, Bac0n_D3luxe
Enter your recommendation: Gr%114d_Cheese
Gr                                                                                                           4202954_Cheese
Good job! Patrick is happy! Now can you serve the second customer?
Sponge Bob wants something outrageous that would break the shop (better be served quick before the shop owner kicks you out!)
Please choose from the following burgers: Pe%to_Portobello, $outhwest_Burger, Cla%sic_Che%s%steak
Enter your recommendation: Cla%sic_Che%s%steak
ClaCla%sic_Che%s%steakic_Che(null)
picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_dc0f36c4}
```

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{7h3_cu570m3r_15_n3v3r_SEGFAULT_dc0f36c4}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- As the hints told me to research on format specifiers, I learnt many types of format specifiers used in C and that you can specify the size of it by adding a number between the `%` and specifier(As used in the question `%114d`)
- I furthered my understanding on C programmming, specifically format specifiers
- I learned what all can cause a segmentation fault in C programs and bettered my understanding on signals in C 

## Notes:

- One other hint was given to simply try all the options, and brute force your way to the flag
- It is possible to cause a segmentation fault in another place to find the flag

## Incorrect Tangents:
- On reading the code, I initially thought it would be similar to buffer overflow so I put random values in the Input section but that did not work
- One of the options had the `%to` in it which is not a real specifier, so I initally thought that was the answer as that could cause errors, But it ended up not giving a segmentation fault and a different error
- Typos
