This challenge launches an instance on demand.
Its current status is: RUNNING



## Solution:

- The challenge started off by giving a .elf file and a C file which I opened and read. I learnt that this code would print the flag by executing it in the terminal
- This program used something called signals which I had to learn to understand and read the code properly
- This still didnt make much sense to me so I looked at the hints. The hints read, "How do you get the code to print the flag" and "do man gets and look in the BUGS section"
- Upon closer inspection of the code, I saw that the flag was printed in a function which took a signal as an argument, another thing I saw was the input had the capacity of 16 characters
- In `man gets` it said that gets() can take more characters than the limit, which could cause segmentation fault
- While learning a signals, I learnt that SIGSEGV is signal type of Segmentation fault
- After understanding all this, I thought about causing a segemntation fault which could send the signal to the function and print the flag
- So I started the instance and put a random input of length greater than 16
- If I am not wrong, this caused a segmentation fault and printed the flag


## Flag:

```
picoCTF{ov3rfl0ws_ar3nt_that_bad_ef01832d}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- I learned more about C programming, specifically signals
- I learned what buffer is, buffer overflow and segmentation faults
- gets() can be dangerous as it accepts more characters than the limit is, this can cause segmentation fault which can leak information and thus instead you need to use fgets()
- I understood further about C programming by solving this challenge
- I read more about .elf files and learn exactly what it is and how often it is used in Binary Exploitation 

## Notes:

- It is possible there was a specific input that was to be used to solve the challenge without overflow
- Accessing the .elf files could help with the answers but I was not able to read the objdump of the elf file

## Incorrect Tangents:
- The first mistake I made was not start the instance before trying to solve the question which puzzled me and wasted time
- Upon reading the code, I fixated on the wrong things, there was a string which said create a debugging flag.txt file. This made me try to create a .txt file hoping the program would write the flag in it.
