# 3. miniRSA

> Let's decrypt this: ciphertext? Something seems a bit small.


## Solution:

- The solution for this challenge was quite simple, The hints given were pretty basic, In RSA encryption, 'e' was used in the form pow(m,e)%n
- In the question we were given, N, e and the cipher text
- From the hints and the name of the challenge, I knew that this was related to RSA, So I simply searched up an online RSA Decoder, entered the known values
- This decrypted it and gave me the flag 


## Flag:

```
picoCTF{n33d_a_lArg3r_e_d0cd6eae}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- As the name implied RSA, I learnt up on RSA and what exactly it is. From what I learnt, it is used in both encryption and decryption, working with two different keys
- The key is generated by using two large prime numbers and multiplying them and then subtracting one from each prime number. This is called the euler Totient function
- Then an encryption constant is chosen, usually it is 65537 and using this a formula is used to generate the cipher text(M^e % n for encryption)

## Notes:

- It is possible that this was not the intended solve, But since I knew what most of the values were, I could simply decrypt it using an online RSA Decoder

## Incorrect Tangents:
-Pretty much nothing went wrong in this challenge, but before researching on RSA, I was confused as to how to manually decrypt the cipher
