# 1. IQ Test

> let your input x = 30478191278.
wrap your answer with nite{ } for the flag.
As an example, entering x = 34359738368 gives (y0, ..., y11), so the flag would be nite{010000000011}.

## Solution:

- The solution for this flag seemed quite straight forward as it only used a complex system of logic gates
- To solve this question, I began with learning about the different types of logic gates to solve the question without errors
- I then converted the given input into a 36-bit integer, as logic gates only use '1' or '0' in them
- I then indivisually solved the logic gates until I had completed the system
- Red is for '0' and Blue is for '1'

## Flag:

```
nite{10010011000}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- This challenged deepened my knowledge on logic gates and helped me practice them to near perfection
- I learned about the various types of logic gates `OR`, `AND`, `NOT`(These being the most important), `NAND`, `NOR`, `XOR`, `XNOR`. When all do these logic gates give a high and low, special cases with more than two inputs. All of this helped me fully understand this topic

## Notes:

- It might be possible to make a program to solve this question for you due to its complexity, mistakes are going to be very common
- Another point to note is that there were errors in the diagrams of the gates, I assume because they were pasted from somewhere which could cause problems in a program

## Incorrect Tangents:
- Hoping nothing went wrong while solving this question, Otherwise this was an error-free challenge
