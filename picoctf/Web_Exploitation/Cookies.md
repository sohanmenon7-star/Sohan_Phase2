## Solution:

- The question had the link of the website and the name of the challenge was the hint, meaning I had to tinker with the cookies of the webpage
- On reaching the webpage, I rightclicked and then went into inspect and then Application, there I saw the Cookies option
- On seeing the cookies and tinkering it with I soon learned you can change the values, refresh the page to see different results
- In the search bar 'snickerdoodle' was written, On typing that it redirected me to another page. I noticed the value of the cookie changed
- On changing the value of the cookie, the display message changed from snickerdoodle to chocolate chip cookies
- So I repeated these steps, changing the value to until 18 which displayed the flag
