# 1. Web Gauntlet

> Can you beat the filters?
Log in as admin http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:62299/
http://shape-facility.picoctf.net:62299/filter.php

## Solution:

- In this question, You were given a link to a webiste in which you need to login as 'admin' using SQL injection
- The output is echoed when you input a username and password, in each round you are to not use some specific characters
- In round 1, you cannot use `OR`. I started with reasearching on common methods to use SQLi. One of the most basic method is to simply type `username'--` since in SQLite, `--` marks the beginning of a single comment, this effectively removes the password condition. So in this challenge I typed `admin'--` as the username and a random pasword to proceed to the next round
- In round 2, You were restricted from using `--` as well. But there is another way to add comments, that is `/*` which adds multiline comments. So similar to the previous round, I simply typed `admin'/*` which made everything after it a comment(Apparently it does not need to be closed for it to change it to a comment)
- In round 3, `AND` and `LIKE` were also banned alongside `<`, `>`. But since `/*` was not banned, the same answer stood for this round too
- In round 4, you were restricted from typing `admin`, So I searched how to concat two strings. I learnt you can do that using `||` operator. So in the username I typed, `ad'||'min'/*`, This allowed me to go into round 5, where `UNION` was banned. Since I had still not used UNION, I simply used the same string to complete the last round
- I was then told to view filter.php, In this file the flag was present

## Flag:

```
picoCTF{y0u_m4d3_1t_79a0ddc6}
```

## Concepts learnt:

- I learned about what SQLi is and how to exploit them. These injections can primarily done when clauses like `WHERE`, `UPDATE` are used
- There are multiple ways to do SQLi, first there is the basic SQLi done by using comments, Then `LIKE`, `IN` and `AND` can be used as well. `UNION` based SQLi can also be used to get the database of multiple tables. There is also Error based SQLi and Boolean based SQLi
- By solving these 5 rounds, I learnt a lot about SQLi and got some good practice

## Notes:

- In two rounds I repeated the same answer as it was not banned, but by looking at the banned characters, its easy to determine that there can be other ways to exploit the SQLi vulnerabilities
- As I learnt about `LIKE`, `IN`, `AND` and `UNION` could also be used. But I am not too sure on how to do this

## Incorrect Tangents:
- I didnt struggle in Round 1, but in Round 2 I tried using `AND` but that did not work
- Trying the multiple comment strategy, I thought it was compulsory to close the multiline comment syntax so I put `*/` in the password hoping it would close but since there was still a `'` out side the comment, it gave an error
